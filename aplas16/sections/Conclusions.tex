\label{sec:conclusions}

We have demonstrated how a DSL with variable bindings could be embedded in types.
With more and more extensions added to the language, Haskell is gradually
 becoming a dependently-typed language,\footnote{Why not be dependently typed? \url{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12961651/why-not-be-dependently-typed}}
 but it's not that dreadful as many (including us) would have thought.
